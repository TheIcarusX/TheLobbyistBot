# TheLobbyistBot
A bot for my private discord server.

This bot was created out of boredom to add utilitarian features to enhance the member experience in my server. This bot includes a few commands (hopefully more to come) such as:
!Ping - A command similar to the test command
!Say - The bot says what you enter after the command. Deletes the command message.
!Rules - Leads users to the rules channel
!PogChamp - The name says it all
!Suggestions - Leads users to the suggestions channel
!Test - Just a boring test command
!Flip - Flips a coin
!Roll - Rolls a six-sided die
!Quote - Randomly chooses a quote to send in the channel
!AddQuote - Adds a quote to the PK1 file

This bot was coded in Python.
