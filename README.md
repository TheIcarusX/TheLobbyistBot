# TheLobbyistBot
A bot for my private discord server.

This bot was created out of boredom to add utilitarian features to enhance the member experience in my server. This bot includes a few commands (hopefully more to come) such as:

!Ping - A command similar to the test command

!Say - The bot says what you enter after the command. Deletes the command message

!Rules - Leads users to the rules channel

!PogChamp - The name says it all. *You will have to create a custom emote to use this command. The emote png file can be found in the same folder as TheLobbyist.py. To get the emote id, type \:Emote:.

!Suggestions - Leads users to the suggestions channel

!Test - Just a boring test command

!Flip - Flips a coin

!Roll - Rolls a six-sided die

!Quote - Randomly chooses a quote to send in the channel

!AddQuote - Adds a quote to the PK1 file

This bot was coded in Python.
